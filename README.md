### Aviator Game Guide: How to Play

The Aviator game follows a unique gameplay style compared to traditional
slots. The objective is to cash out before the plane flies away. Here\'s
a step-by-step guide to playing Aviator:

1.  **Place Your Bet**: Select the amount you wish to bet. You can place
    two bets at the same time, allowing you to diversify your
    strategies.
2.  **Watch the Multiplier**: After placing your bet, a plane will begin
    to take off, and a multiplier will increase as the plane flies.
3.  **Cash Out**: The goal is to cash out before the plane flies away.
    The longer the plane stays in the air, the higher the multiplier,
    but if it flies away before you cash out, you lose your bet.

The game's simplicity is what makes it so appealing. The decision of
when to cash out is crucial, balancing the risk and reward factor.
